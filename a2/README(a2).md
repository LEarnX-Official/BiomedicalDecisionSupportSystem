# 🔍 Process Mining & Automata Learning – Controllability Analysis

## 📘 Overview

This project presents a **complete pipeline** for analyzing process behavior using **Process Mining** and **Automata Learning** techniques. Through three progressive assignments, we extract, evaluate, and visualize processes using Petri nets and Markov models with a focus on **controllability analysis**.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **🧠 Entropy & Information Gain Analysis**
- **📈 Full Petri Net Visualizations**
- **📊 Trace Alignment & Model Quality Evaluation**
- **⚙️ Controllability Assessment via Relabeling & Entropy Metrics**
- **🎨 High-quality Visuals** for Petri nets, entropy plots, and comparisons

## 📂 Assignments Breakdown

### ✅ Assignment 1: Markov Process Construction
- Extract Petri Nets using **Inductive**, **Alpha**, and **Heuristics** algorithms
- Build Markov models from event logs
- Perform trace alignment and visualize conformance quality

### ✅ Assignment 2: Entropy and Information Gain
- Calculate **state** and **process-level** entropy
- Derive **information gain** to assess decision point clarity
- Visualize uncertainty across process models

### ✅ Assignment 3: Trace Test & Controllability
- Relabel traces based on control scenarios (Sets A & B)
- Compare entropy pre/post relabeling
- Quantify and visualize process controllability

## 📊 Key Formulas

- **State Entropy**: H(Q) = -∑ P(Q→Qi) × log₂ P(Q→Qi)  
- **Process Entropy**: H(Process) = ∑ P(Q) × H(Q)  
- **Information Gain**: IG = H(Process) - H(TraceTest)
