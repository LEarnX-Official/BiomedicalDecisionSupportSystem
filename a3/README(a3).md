# README - Trees and Random Forests for Time Series Classification

## Overview

This repository presents a high-performance implementation of **PromptTree algorithms** and **Random Forest models** tailored for univariate and multivariate time series classification. The solution is built with a focus on modular design, reproducibility, and rigorous evaluation in supervised and unsupervised learning contexts.

## Features

- **PromptTree**: Implements RST (Reference Slice Tests) and CRST (Channel Reference Slice Tests)
- **Random Forest**:
  - Majority, weighted, and historical voting
  - Feature bagging and bootstrapping
  - Isolation Forest mode for anomaly detection
- **Distance Metrics**: Breiman, Zhu, RatioRF with configurable parameters
- **Clustering**: Hierarchical clustering with purity, entropy, ARI, and silhouette analysis
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, conformal prediction, statistical testing, and performance benchmarking
- **Visualizations**: 13+ professional plots and analysis visuals
